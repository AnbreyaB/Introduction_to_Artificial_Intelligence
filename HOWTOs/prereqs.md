# HOWTO Cover the Course Prereqisits

Studying the material requires

* advanced Python programming skills.
* practical knowledge of how to implement data structures (Big-O notation, search trees).
* a working knowledge of probability theory and combinatorics.

You should have good practical knowledge of these topics from courses on programming, data structures and algorithms,
and discrete math and statistics. If you feel not well prepared in one of the areas then here are some pointers on how to
prepare.

## Python Skills

* W3Schools: [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) (go through sections as needed)
* W3Schools: [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (go through "Basic")
* W3Schools: [Pandas Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp) (go through "Basic")
* Dataquest: [Intro to Jupyter Notebook](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

## Data Strucutres and Algorithms

* [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&list=RDCMUC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ)

## Probability Theory and Combinatorics

* Khan Academy: [Statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability). You need at least 
[Unit 7 Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library) and [Unit 8 Counting, permutations, and combinations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/counting-permutations-and-combinations).
